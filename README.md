# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the company Pewlett Hackard with data for the amount of upcoming retirees and their titles. This data will help the company be prepared for upcoming need of new employees and forecast for their expected hiring process.

## Results
* The company currently has 90,398 positions that will be opening soon based on the number of retirees. Most of these positions are "Senior" or "Leader" positions which can be seen by this graphic:

* Pewlett Hackard is a huge company with tens of thousands of employees. We had to first sort and clean the data to verify that we were only accounting for each employee once.
* While there are 90,398 positions opening, only 1,549 current employees have mentorship eligibility. This leaves a large gap in training for the next generation of leaders in the company.
* Pewlett Hackard will have to devise an efficient way to train current and new-hire employees in order to continue to run the business smoothly. Could those that are eligible for mentoring train more than one person for their job? If mentors could train multiple people, this would help resolve at least some of the issues with replacing the retiring employees.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There will be 90,398 employees retiring from the company. Pewlett Hackard will need to prepare ahead of time to train employees for promotion and also for training employees that will be brand new to the company.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

No. There are only 1,549 employees that are eligible for mentorship. As stated above, if mentors could train multiple employees, this would help to at least close the gap for replacing especially the "Senior" and "Leader" roles within the company.
